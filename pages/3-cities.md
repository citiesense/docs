##What are "cities"?
Cities are municipal areas that Citiesense organizes spatial data around. 

Each municipality with an account on Citiesense has its own version of the interactive Citiesense map. 

Anyone that visits Citiesense can use a city's map to research real estate in that municipality. 

This interactive map of a city is called the __Property Research Portal (PReP)__.
