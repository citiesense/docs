## Using a City Map
Citiesense consolidates the real property research process into a single, sharable map. A city-wide version of this map is called a __City Map__. Each city with an account on Citiesense has a publicly accessible City Page. City Maps are designed to save the real estate industry time and alleviate the frustration of needing to go between several different websites in order to collect and understand real estate data.

### Features of a City Map
In order to simplify the process of aggregating and understanding real estate data across a number of cities, each city on Citiesense has the same interface for its City Map. 

The controls for the map are located on a sidebar that can be brought into view by clicking the control icon in the upper left corner of the map. It looks like this: ![alt text](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1561/25336832970_ecd3ce984d_s.jpg "control")

The features of the sidebar include:
* Data search filters: ![alt text](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1678/25330899790_0b960ca8d5_s.jpg "filters"),
* Data layers: ![alt text](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1461/25626840665_d6d79da01b_s.jpg "layers"), and

Citiesenses also enables users to add their own content to a City Map. For more information about this, take a look at [Project Owners](http://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/9-Project%20Owners.md)

Each city featured on Citiesense has its own version of a City Map. Some City Maps are more comprehensive than others with regards to the amount of data available, but they are all organized the same way with 4 categories of information pertaining to individual properties, land use, market activity and demographics. 

### City Data Categories
