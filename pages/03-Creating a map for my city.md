## How do I create an interactive City Map for my city?
To create a map for your city, please contact us at info@citiesense.com.

Each municipality with an account on Citiesense has its own version of the interactive City Map. For example, here is [New York City's](http://www.citiesense.com/cities/new-york-city?p%5Bper_page%5D=all&p%5Bcity_id%5D=398#13/40.7127/-74.0059) version of the City Map. 

Anyone that visits Citiesense can use a City Map to explore real estate data directly related to that municipality. 

## Where does the data come from?
Almost all of the information on a City Map is from public sources. Additionally, some of the data is created and maintained by Citiesense users. User-created data is exclusive to a user-created project page, which can be seen as orange, blue, and green dots on the City Map. Anyone with a Citiesense account can be a [Project Owner](http://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/9-Project%20Owners.md) and manage data on their own individual pages that feature maps generated from a City Map.
