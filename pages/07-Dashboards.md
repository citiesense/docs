## What is a Dashboard?
Dashboards organize information about a neighborhood into a clear overview. Dashboards also enable you and your team to share this information with others by creating custom maps and reports using your neighborhood data. 

Creating a Dashboard for an [Area](https://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/02-Getting%20Started.md) is simple. Once your Area is Saved, click the dashboard icon ![alt text](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2841/33773722236_c4058c7980_s.jpg "dashboard icon") in the Area tool bar.
