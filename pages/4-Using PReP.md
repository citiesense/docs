## Using the Property Research Portal (PReP)
Citiesense consolidates the real property research process into a single, sharable map. A city-wide version of this map is called the __Property Research Portal__, or __PReP__ for short. This is designed to save the real estate industry time and alleviate the frustration of needing to go between several different websites in order to research properties and underwrite real estate opportunities. 

### PReP Features
In order to simplify the property research process across all cities, each city on Citiesense has the same interface for its Property Research Portal. 
The features of this interface include:
* Data Filters: ![alt text](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1532/24312981384_2ff912b930_s.jpg "filters"),
* Data Layers,
* Basemap toggles, and
* the capability of adding a Project to the PReP map. 

Each City featured on Citiesense has its own version of a PReP. Some Property Research Portals are more comprehensive than others with regards to the amount of data available, but they are all organized the same way with 4 categories of data pertaining to urban real estate. 

### PReP Data Categories
