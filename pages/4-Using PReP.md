## Using the Property Research Portal (PReP)
Citiesense consolidates the real property research process into a single, sharable map. A city-wide version of this map is called the __Property Research Portal__, or __PReP__ for short. This is designed to save the real estate industry time and alleviate the frustration of needing to go between several different websites in order to research properties and underwrite real estate opportunities. 

### PReP Features
In order to simplify the property research process across all cities, each city on Citiesense has the same interface for its Property Research Portal. 
The features of this interface include:
* Data Filters:

* Data Layers,
* Basemap toggles, and
* the capability of adding a Project to the PReP map. 

Each City featured on Citiesense has its own version of a PReP. Some Property Research Portals are more comprehensive than others with regards to the amount of data available, but they are all organized the same way with 4 categories of data about a urban real estate. 

### PReP Data Categories
* __Properties:__ This category includes all data about individual properties. This includes property data at the parcel/tax lot level, such as lot size, owner name, address, number of buildings, etc. It also includes legal information about a property, such as deeds and title information. 
* __Land Use:__ This category includes layers of information about land use regulations, policies and programs for a city. These layers include zoning overlays, flood zones, historic preservations areas, and special districts, such as Business Improvement Districts or BIDs.
* __Market:__ This category includes layers of information that pertain to the local real estate market. These layers include building permit data from a city's Department of Buildings, real estate listings data and transactions data.
* __Demographics:__ This category includes demographic and socio-economic data layers. These are currently all pulled from the US Census and American Community Survey. The information in these layers ranges from median household income to total population by age groups.
