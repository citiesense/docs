## What are Tables?
**Tables are a set of connected datasets for all data about properties, streetscapes, and contacts that are associated with an Area on the map.** 

These include:
- **Development Activity
- **Listings *(Represented as Available Space and **Commercial Real Estate** on the map)*
- **Tenants *(Represented as **Businesses & Attractions** on the map)*
- **Units
- **Contacts
- **Streetscape Assets
- **Streetescape Issues
- **Events

Any data that you *and your teammates* add to properties and streetscapes will always be accessible through the [Tables](https://www.citiesense.com/tables) interface. 

Additionally Tables can be filtered to show only records for any of your saved [Areas](https://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/02-Getting%20Started.md). From the Tables interface use the Areas dropdown menu. 

Otherwise, once your Area is *saved*, click the Tables icon 
![alt text](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4416/36903352205_0bf19a1da0_s.jpg "Tables icon") in the Area tool bar to navigate to the Tables view of the saved Area. 

## How do I import my own data into the Tables?
You can instantly import your private data into the tables where it will automatically be mapped and connected to other records. Use the blue "Upload csv" button located on the far right-hand side to get started.
