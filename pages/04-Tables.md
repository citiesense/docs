## What are Tables?
**The Tables feature generates a set of connected tables for all data about properties, streetscapes, and contacts that are associated with an Area on the map.** 


Any data that you *and your teammates* add to properties and streetscapes will always be accessible through the Tables interface by creating an Area around those properties and streets and generating a set of tables for that Area. 

Generating a set of Tables for an [Area](https://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/02-Getting%20Started.md) is simple. 
Once your Area is *saved*, click the Tables icon

You can always instantly generate Tables as a way to view and manage local data based on any of your saved Areas.
