## Getting Started with Areas
Citiesense makes it simple and fast to access and organize information about specific areas in a city. Whether a neighborhood, a couple of blocks, or a large section of the city, start by setting up an Area on the City Map to begin organizing, analyzing and tracking information from a variety of public and private data sources. 
 
*__It's completely FREE to add an Area to your account, so let's get started.__*
