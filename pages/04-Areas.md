## Getting Started with Areas
Citiesense makes it simple and fast to access and organize information about specific areas in a city. Whether a neighborhood, a couple of blocks, or a large section of the city, start by setting up an Area on the City Map to begin organizing, analyzing and tracking information from a variety of public and private data sources. 
 
*__It's completely FREE to add an Area to your account, so let's get started.__*

__Step 2__
Click your cursor anywhere on the map to begin creating a shape around your preferred Area. If you make a mistake, don't worry. You will have the opportunity to edit this shape in Step 3. _(Note: Clicking rather than holding down the cursor and dragging.)_

Your new Area will help keep you in-the-know about this part of the city. You're now able to:

- Share Maps to showcase local conditions in your new Area.

![alt text](https://github.com/citiesense/docs/blob/master/images/New%20Area%20-%20Alerts.png?raw=true "Alerts.")
- Instantly perform complex spatial analysis of data from a range of public sources, such as US Census data on demographics and municipal data on the individual tax lots in the Area.
