## Project Owners
Anyone with an account on Citiesense can be a Project Owner. Project Owners can create their own pages with custom versions of a City Map. These custom user created pages for Projects are designed to help the following professionals share information about a location:

### __Commercial real estate brokers and agents__

List a commercial property either for lease or for sale and publish this to a City Map

_Real estate brokers and agents can create and share Available Projects to promote commercial real estate listings by logging into an account on Citiesense and clicking the blue "Add a new project" button in the upper right corner of the [My Projects](http://www.citiesense.com/dashboard) page, or by following [this link](http://www.citiesense.com/projects/new). The Project's Status will need to be set to "Available" in order to add information about a commercial listing._ 

_The map on a Project's page can then be embedded on any website or blog to share details about a commercial property ranging from property and land use data to demographic and market data._ 

### __Commercial property owners/developers__

Promote a future or current commercial space either for lease or for sale, and showcase this opportunity in the context of surrounding development activity.

_Similarly, property owners can create and share Available Projects to promote commercial real estate listings by logging into an account on Citiesense and clicking the blue "Add a new project" button in the upper right corner of the [My Projects](http://www.citiesense.com/dashboard) page, or by following [this link](http://www.citiesense.com/projects/new). The Project's Status will need to be set to "Available" in order to add information about a commercial listing._ 

_The map on a Project Page can then be embedded on any third party website or blog to share details about a commercial property ranging from property and land use data to demographic and market data._ 

### __Media companies and real estate journalists__

Add a map that includes properties that are mentioned in the content of a publication or blog post. 

_Journalists and other media content creators do not need to be a Project Owner in order to use a map that already exists on a Project's page. These maps are always publicly available to be embedded on third party websites. To search for an existing Project Page with a map for a specific property, use the [Project Search page](http://www.citiesense.com/search) or a [City Map page](http://www.citiesense.com/cities)._

_If the a Project Page does not exist for the subject property, simply create a new Project Page with an account on Citiesense. Journalists can create a Project Page by logging into an account on Citiesense and clicking the blue "Add a new project" button in the upper right corner of the [My Projects](http://www.citiesense.com/dashboard) page, or by following [this link](http://www.citiesense.com/projects/new)._
