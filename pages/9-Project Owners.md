## Project Owners
Anyone with an account on Citiesense can be a Project Owner. Project Owners can create their own pages with custom versions of a City Map. These pages, called Project Pages are designed to help the following professionals with their mapping related workflows:

### __Media companies and real estate journalists__

How do I create a map that includes properties that I want to write about or mention in the content of my publication? 

_Journalists and other media content creators do not need to be a Project Owner in order to use a map that already exists on a Project Page. These maps are always publicly available to be embedded on third party websites. To search for an existing Project Page with a map for a specific property, use the [Project Search page](http://www.citiesense.com/search) or a [City Map page](http://www.citiesense.com/cities)._

_If the a Project Page does not exist for the subject property, simply create a new Project Page with an account on Citiesense. Journalists can create a Project Page by logging into an account on Citiesense and clicking the blue "Add a new project" button in the upper right corner of the [My Projects](http://www.citiesense.com/dashboard) page, or by following [this link](http://www.citiesense.com/projects/new)._
