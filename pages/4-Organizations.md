## Organizations
Citiesense has enterprise accounts available for organizations that wish to use our data-rich map to help facilitate economic development for a city or a select neighborhood or district within a city. 

There are two User Types for enterprise accounts: City Managers and District Managers. 

### __User Types__

_District Managers are users that are part of an enterprise account for a district organization such as a Business Improvement District (BID), Business Improvement Area (BIA), or Special Services District (SSD)_
