## What are Projects?

Use Projects and their [**Pages**](https://www.citiesense.com/projects/3287 "example of a project page") to manage and share your local insight about an [**area**](https://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/02-Areas.md).
Projects are user-created records about a property. Users can create Projects to share their local insight about any property in the city. 
Here are some examples of Projects:
- Showcase **local businesses and attractions** and provide an accurate understanding of the existing mix of retailers. 
- Share and track the status of **development activity**.
- Promote **listings for available commercial space** for retail, office, industrial and other tenants that might move to a neighborhood.

## Adding your local data about a property is easy.

### Step 1 - Find the property
Use the [**map**](https://www.citiesense.com/cities/new-york-city "City Map") to type in an address or navigate to the property you want to add or edit data for. Click on the blue edit button in the sidebar to open the edit modal and select the type of data you are adding, i.e. a business, a listing for a vacant space, or development activity.

### Step 2 - Fill out the form
Use the form to enter information about the property. For example, you might add the name of a business and a photo of the new storefront, or you might show the asking rent for a commercial space if you keep track of available listings for vacant storefronts.
