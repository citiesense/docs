## What are Projects?

Use Projects and Pages to manage and share your local insight about an [**area**](https://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/02-Areas.md).
Projects are user-created records about a property. Users can create Projects to share their local insight about any property in the city. 
Here are some examples of Projects:
- Showcase local businesses and provide an accurate understanding of the existing mix of retailers. 
- Share and track the status of development activity.
- Promote available commercial space for retail, office, industrial and other tenants that might move to a neighborhood.
