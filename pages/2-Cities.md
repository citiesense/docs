## What are __Cities__?
__Cities__ are locally governed areas that Citiesense organizes spatial data for. The data related to a City falls within the boundaries of a given municipality.

Each municipality with an account on Citiesense has its own version of the interactive Citiesense map. For example, here is [New York City's](http://www.citiesense.com/cities/new-york-city?p%5Bper_page%5D=all&p%5Bcity_id%5D=398#13/40.7127/-74.0059) version of the Citiesense map. 

Anyone that visits Citiesense can use a City's map to explore real estate data directly related to that municipality. 

The interactive map of a City is called the [City Page](http://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/4-Using%20City%20Pages.md).
