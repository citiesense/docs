## Getting Started with Areas
Citiesense makes it simple and fast to access and organize information about specific areas in a city. Whether a neighborhood, a couple of blocks, or a large section of the city, start by setting up an Area on the City Map to begin organizing, analyzing and tracking information from a variety of public and private data sources. 
 
*__It's completely FREE to add an Area to your account, so let's get started.__*

### Add your first Area


__Step 1__
Click the blue __"New Area"__ button in the upper right hand corner of the map. 


__Step 2__
Click your cursor anywhere on the map to begin creating a shape around your preferred Area. If you make a mistake, don't worry. You will have the opportunity to edit this shape in Step 3. _(Note: Clicking rather than holding down the cursor and dragging.)_
 
 
 __Step 3__
 Click the blue __"Done"__ button to either __"Edit"__ your shape and change the Area boundary, or click __"Save"__ to add the Area to your account. You will also receive an email confirming that you are subscribed to receive alerts about building permits for the Area you saved.
 
Your new Area will help keep you in-the-know about this part of the city. You're now able to:

- Subscribe to datasets like the City's building permits system to track development activity for properties in your Area.  
- Instantly perform complex spatial analysis of data from a range of public sources, such as US Census data on demographics and municipal data on the individual tax lots in the Area. 
- Add and analyze your own data about properties in the Area by creating [Pages](https://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/05-Pages.md) in your Citiesense Account.
