## Getting Started with Areas
Citiesense makes it simple and fast to access and organize information about specific areas in a city. Whether a neighborhood, a couple of blocks, or a large section of the city, start by setting up an Area on the City Map to begin organzing, analyzing and tracking information from a comprehensive stack of data sources. 
 
*__It's completely FREE to add an Area to your account, so let's get started.__*

### Add your first Area


__Step 1__
Click the blue __"New Area"__ button in the upper right hand corner of the map. 


__Step 2__
Click your cursor anywhere on the map to begin creating a shape around your preferred Area. If you make a mistake, don't worry. You will have the opportunity to edit this shape in Step 3. _(Note: Clicking rather than holding down the cursor and dragging.)_
 
 
 __Step 3__
 Click the blue __"Done"__ button to either __"Edit"__ your shape and change the Area boundary, or click __"Save"__ to add the Area to your account. 
 
Your new Area will help keep you in the know about this part of the city. You can:

- Subscribe to datasets like the City's building permits system to track development activity for properties in your Area.  
- Instantly perform complex spatial analysis of data from a range of public sources, such as US Census data on demographics and municipal data on the individual tax lots in the Area. 
- Add your own insight about properties in the Area by creating _Projects_ in your Citiesense Account.
