## Using Areas to subscribe to Building Permit Alerts
Once you have saved an [**Area**](https://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/02-Areas.md), you will be automatically *subscribed* to receive a daily email alert whenever building permit activity occurs for properties in that Area. Subscribing to **Alerts** means you will receive an email every morning any time a Building Permit is filed for or pulled, and when a new Certificate of Occupancy is issued for any property in your saved Area. 
 
*__To unsubscribe or resubscribe to Alerts for an Area, click the bell icon on the Area toolbar on the [map page](https://www.citiesense.com/cities/new-york-city).__*
