### Add your first Area


__Step 1__
Click the blue  N E W   A R E A  button in the upper right hand corner of the map. 


__Step 2__
Click your cursor anywhere on the map to begin creating a shape around your preferred Area. If you make a mistake, don't worry. You will have the opportunity to edit this shape in Step 3. _(Note: Clicking rather than holding down the cursor and dragging.)_
 
 
 __Step 3__
 Click the blue "Done" button to either "Edit" your shape and change the Area boundary, or click "Save" to add the Area to your account. 
 
Your new Area will help keep you in the know about this part of the city. You can:

- Subscribe to datasets like the City's building permits system to track development activity for properties in your Area.  
- Instantly perform complex spatial analysis of data from a range of public sources, such as US Census data on demographics and municipal data on the individual tax lots in the Area. 
- Add your own insight about properties in the Area by creating _Projects_ in your Citiesense Account.
