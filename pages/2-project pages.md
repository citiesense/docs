What is a "project"?
A "project" is a real estate related initiative that is related to one or more properties, also known as parcels. Citiesense enables users to create "project pages" with data-rich property maps that showcase real estate projects. Project pages can be used for either marketing or for research. 

There are 3 types of project pages that users can create and add to the public city data maps for marketing:
O Available listings (for sale and for lease commercial real estate listings)
O Development projects in progress (approved development projects moving forward with construction)
O Recently completed development projects (development projects completed within the past 5 years) 

For research, a user can create a private page for a "pipeline project" and share this page with group of teammates or collaborators. Pipeline Project Pages can be made public for marketing when the project is approved and in progress to being completed.
