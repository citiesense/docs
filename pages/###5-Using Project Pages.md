## Using Project Pages

Project Pages can be made public or private.

When a Project Page is _published_ to a __City Page__, it can be used for __public engagement__, __media__ and __real estate marketing__. 

When a Project Page is _private_, it can be used for planning and research for real estate related tasks, such as __investment analysis and due diligence__, __site selection__, __property assemblages__, __land use studies__, __masterplans__, and many other such tasks. 

### __Published Project Pages__
There are 3 types of project pages that users can create and add to the public city data maps for marketing:
* __Available:__ available listings (for sale and for lease commercial real estate listings)
* __In Progress:__ development projects in progress (approved development projects moving forward with construction)
* __Completed:__ recently completed development projects (development projects completed within the past 5 years) 

### __Private Project Pages__
A user can create a private page and share this page with a group of teammates or collaborators. Private pages can help with a variety of real estate related processes. Here are a few:
* __Pipeline Project Pages__ This type of page is commonly used by real estate investors and developers. Pipeline Project Pages can be used to help streamline project management for an investment opportunity from the due dilligence and planning phases through to the approvals phase. Pipeline Project Pages can also be made public for marketing when the project is approved and in progress of being completed.
* __Land Use Planning Pages__ This type of page is designed for real estate consultants, urban designers and city planners. Land Use Planning Pages can be used to help assemble data several properties that might be improved based on changes to the use.
* __Orgnaziation Formation Pages__ This type of page is used to form a non profit that has an ownership or management stake in a parcel or assemblage of parcels. Often this page helps with creating a new Business Improvement District or a Land Trust.
