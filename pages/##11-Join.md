### About Citiesense
Decisions about where, what and when to build new buildings, improve infrastructure, or open new businesses are big decisions that impact cities at the neighborhood scale. To help with these decisions, Citiesense is establishing a Neighborhood Knowledge Platform, enabling cities to organize fresh information for the real estate industry, from the neighborhood up, and drive development toward the best outcomes.

The platform is currently being created and tested in partnership with several neighborhood organizations in New York City that manage Business Improvement Districts (BIDs).
