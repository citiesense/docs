## Managing your Team
Managing neighborhoods is a complex time intensive process. Sometimes it helps to collaborate with staff and stakeholders as a team. Citiesense enables each neighborhood organization's account to be team-based. Admin users can invite and manage the roles of different teammates by visiting the Users page for the account at [citiesense.com/users](https://www.citiesense.com/users).


### Add a team mate


__Step 1__
To add a new teammate to your organization's account, first click the ["New User"](https://www.citiesense.com/users/invitation/new) button in the upper right corner. 


__Step 2__
Fill in the user's details and an invitation will be emailed to the new teammate. 
 
 
 __Step 3__
Once you're ready, click the __Send Invitation__ button and an invitation will be emailed to the recipient, providing them with a link to login to the account. The link will expire after 12 hours, so if they do not respond, you may need to resend this invitation by repeating this process when they are ready to accept the invitation. 
 

### Changing the Role of a team mate


Any time a new teammate is added, the default role will be 'employee'. If you'd like to grant a new teammate the admin role, you will need to select that from the dropdown menu under __Role__.
