## What are "cities"?
Cities are locally governed areas that Citiesense organizes spatial data around. The data in one of these areas all falls within the boundaries of a given municipality.

Each municipality with an account on Citiesense has its own version of the interactive Citiesense map. For example, here is [New York City's](http://www.citiesense.com/cities/new-york-city?p%5Bper_page%5D=all&p%5Bcity_id%5D=398#13/40.7127/-74.0059) version of the Citiesense map. 

Anyone that visits Citiesense can use a city's map to research real estate in that municipality. 

This interactive map of a city is called the __Property Research Portal (PReP)__.
