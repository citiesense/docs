## What is a Dashboard?
Dashboards organize you information about a neighborhood into a clear overview and enable you and your team to share this information with others by creating Maps. Creating a Dashboard for an [Area](https://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/02-Getting%20Started.md) is simple. Once your Area is Saved, click the dashboard icon in the Area tool bar. You can set up a Dashboard for any of your Areas.
