## Using Project Pages

Citiesense enables any user with an account to create a webpage for a real estate or planning project. These webpages are called Project Pages. 

A Project Page can be _private_ and only accessible to the user who created it and other users he or she invites to the page as teammates, or the page can be made _public_ and visible to anyone that visits a City Page or searches for Projects on the platform. 

Project Pages can used to improve the workflow of a variety of tasks.
