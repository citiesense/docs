## What are Pages?

Use Projects and their [**Pages**](https://www.citiesense.com/projects/3287 "example of a project page") to manage and share your local insight about an [**area**](https://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/02-Areas.md).
Projects are user-created records about a property. Users can create Projects to share their local insight about any property in the city. 
Here are some examples of Projects:
- Showcase **local businesses and attractions** and provide an accurate understanding of the existing mix of retailers. 
- Share and track the status of **development activity**.
- Promote **listings for available commercial space** for retail, office, industrial and other tenants that might move to a neighborhood.

## Adding your local data about a property is easy.

### Step 1 - Find the property.
Use the [**map**](https://www.citiesense.com/cities/new-york-city "City Map") to type in an address or navigate to the property you want to add or edit data for. Click on the blue edit button in the sidebar to open the edit modal and select the type of data you are adding, i.e. a business, a listing for a vacant space, or development activity.

### Step 2 - Add information using the forms.
Use the form to enter information about the property. For example, you might add the name of a business and a photo of the new storefront, or you might show the asking rent for a commercial space if you keep track of available listings for vacant storefronts.

### Step 3 - Create the new record.
Once you have all your data about the property and any photos added to the form, go ahead and click on the blue **Create** button at the bottom. You will need to refresh the page or select another property in order for this new record to show up as part of this property you just add the information to on the sidebar.

## Managing your data for properties is also easy.

### Example - Change one of your commercial spaces to Vacant when a Tenant moves out.
Use the [**map**](https://www.citiesense.com/cities/new-york-city "City Map") to type in an address or business name, or navigate to the property you need to edit. In the sidebar that shows the property records, find the business record and click on the green edit icon beside the business name. In the form that opens, click the red "Make Vacant" button to change this tenant to a "past tenant" and make the unit into a "Vacancy".
