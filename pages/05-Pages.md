## What are Pages?

Use [**Pages**](https://www.citiesense.com/projects/3287 "example of a Page") to manage, track and share the status of different neighborhood assets in an [**area**](https://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/02-Areas.md).
Pages share user-created records about a property or a street condition. Users can create Pages to share their local insight about any property or streetscape in the city. 
Here are some examples of Pages:
- Showcase **Local Businesses and Attractions** and provide an accurate understanding of the existing mix of retailers. 
- Share and track the status of **Development Activity**.
- Promote **Listings for available commercial space** for retail, office, industrial and other tenants that might move to a neighborhood.
- Track **Streetscape Assets** to keep records of where there are issues with things like **Tree Pits**, **Waste Bins**, **Benches**, and **Lamp Posts**.

## Adding your local data about a *Property* or a *Streetscape* is easy.

### Step 1 - Find the property or the exact location in the street.
Use the [**map**](https://www.citiesense.com/cities/new-york-city "City Map") to type in an address or navigate to the property you want to add or edit data for. Click on the blue edit button in the sidebar to open the edit modal and select the type of data you are adding, i.e. a business, a listing for a vacant space, or development activity.

### Step 2 - Add information using the forms.
Use the form to enter information about the property or streetscape location. For example, you might add the name of a business and a photo of the new storefront, or you might show the asking rent for a commercial space if you keep track of available listings for vacant storefronts. Or you might add a Tree Pit to show that there is an operational streetscape asset serving its role providing shade on hot sunny days and storm water management during wet and rainy days.

### Step 3 - Create the new record.
Once you have all your data about the property or streetscape asset, and any photos added to the form, go ahead and click on the blue **Create** button at the bottom. You will need to refresh the page or select another property in order for this new record to show up as part of this property you just add the information to on the sidebar.

## Updating your data for *Properties* and *Streetscapes* is quick and easy too.

### Example - Change one of your commercial spaces to Vacant when a Tenant moves out.
Use the [**map**](https://www.citiesense.com/cities/new-york-city "City Map") to type in an address or business name, or navigate to the property you need to edit. In the sidebar that shows the property records, find the business record and click on the green edit icon beside the business name. In the form that opens, click the red "Make Vacant" button to change this tenant to a "past tenant" and make the unit into a "Vacancy".
