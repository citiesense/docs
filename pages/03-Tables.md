## What are Tables?
The Tables feature generates a set of Tables for all data about properties, streetscapes and contacts that are associated with an Area on the map. 

Any data you and your teammates add to properties and streetscapes will always be accessible through the Tables interface by creating an Area around those properties and streets and generating a set of tables for that Area. 

Generating a set of Tables for an [Area](https://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/02-Getting%20Started.md) is simple. 
Once your Area is Saved, click the Tables icon

You can always instantly generate Tables as a way to view and manage data based on any of your saved Areas.
