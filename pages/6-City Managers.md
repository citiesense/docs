__Who is a City Manager?__

_City Managers are users that are part of an enterprise account maintained by a municipality on Citiesense._

__How do I embed the map of my city on a website or blog?__

_On every embeddable Citiesense map, there is a button in the upper right hand corner that says “Embed”. To embed this map, click the Embed button, then the “Copy” button to copy the embed code and paste this code into your website or blog_ 

__Who can use an enterprise account for a municipality?__

_A municipality with an enterprise account on Citiesense may invite an unlimited number of users to share access to their enterprise account, as City Managers.  Only users that are affiliated with this enterprise account, either because they were invited or because the account was set up for them initially, can use the municipality’s account._ 

__Who can see the enterprise account dashboards for a municipality?__

_Only City Managers can see the dashboards managed as part of an enterprise account for a municipality._

__How do I add a project to the map?__

_Start by either searching for an address in a city on Citiesense (provide the address search feature here like it is on the homepage maybe) or by browsing properties on one of the city map pages: [Select a city](http://www.citiesense.com/cities)_  

__Can I change a project that I did not create / do not own?__

_If you are a City Manager or a District Manager and a project is publicly displayed on the City or District map that you are managing, then you are able to edit that project_

__Can other users change a project that I own?__

_If another user is a City Manager or a District Manager and your project is publicly displayed on a City or District map that the other user manages, then that user is able to edit your project._
