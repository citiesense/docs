##What are "projects"?
"__Projects__" are real estate related initiatives that are related to one or more properties, also known as parcels. 

##What is a Project Page?
Citiesense enables users to create "[project pages](http://www.citiesense.com/projects/3772)" with data-rich property maps that showcase real estate projects. __Project Pages__ can be used for either __marketing__ or for __research__. 

###For Marketing
There are 3 types of project pages that users can create and add to the public city data maps for marketing:
* Available listings (for sale and for lease commercial real estate listings)
* Development projects in progress (approved development projects moving forward with construction)
* Recently completed development projects (development projects completed within the past 5 years) 

###For Research
A user can create a private page for a "pipeline project" and share this page with group of teammates or collaborators. __Pipeline Project Pages__ can be made public for marketing when the project is approved and in progress to being completed.
