## Where does the data come from?
Citiesense connects you to open data portals and enables you to add your information about a neighborhood on top of existing public datasets, when available. This means that some of the information in Citiesense is from public data and some of the information is private and comes from [neighborhood communities](https://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/08-Communities.md), as well as other user managing their data on the platform.
