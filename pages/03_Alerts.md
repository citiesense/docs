## Using Areas to subscribe to Building Permit Alerts
Once you have saved an [**Area**](https://www.citiesense.com/docs/pages/02-Areas.md) you can subscribe to recieve an alert whenever building permits are filed for properties in that Area. Subscribing to **Alerts** means you will recieve an email every morning any time a Building Permit is filed for or pulled, and when a new Cirtificate of Occupancy is issued for any property in your saved Area. 
 
*__To unsubscribe or resubscibe to Alerts for an Area, click the bell icon on the Area toolbar on the [map page](https://www.citiesense.com/cities/new-york-city).__*
