## What are _Projects_?
__Projects__ are real estate related initiatives that are directly associated with one or more properties, also known as parcels. 

Projects are representd by color dots on a City Page map. 

Each Project has its own dedicated webpage, which provides more details about the Project including an interactive map of the properties associated with the project. These webpages are called [Project Pages](http://www.citiesense.com/projects/3772)
