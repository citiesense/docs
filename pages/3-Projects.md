## What are "projects"?
"__Projects__" are real estate related initiatives that are directly associated with one or more properties, also known as parcels. 

## What is a Project Page?
Citiesense enables users to create "[project pages](http://www.citiesense.com/projects/3772)" with data-rich property maps that showcase real estate projects. __Project Pages__ can be used for either __marketing__ or for __research__. 

### __For Marketing__
There are 3 types of project pages that users can create and add to the public city data maps for marketing:
* __Available:__ available listings (for sale and for lease commercial real estate listings)
* __In Progress:__ development projects in progress (approved development projects moving forward with construction)
* __Completed:__ recently completed development projects (development projects completed within the past 5 years) 

### __For Research__
A user can create a private page for a "pipeline project" and share this page with a group of teammates or collaborators. 
* __Pipeline Project Pages__ can be made public for marketing when the project is approved and in progress of being completed.
