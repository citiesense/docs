__Who can use an enterprise account for a district?__

_A district within a municipality that has an account on Citiesense may invite an unlimited number of users to share access to the district enterprise account, as District Managers.  Only users that are affiliated with this enterprise account, either because they were invited or because the account was set up for them initially, can use the district’s account_
